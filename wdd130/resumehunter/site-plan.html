      <h3>[Experience]</h3>
      <p>
        [From April 2019 to present, I have built a diverse and impactful professional journey, spanning various industries and roles. As a co-founder, technician, and outreach specialist at Foucher Tech, my focus has been on providing personalized and convenient tech support experiences to clients, particularly seniors. I excel in addressing software and hardware concerns, troubleshooting connectivity issues, and ensuring optimal functionality across a range of devices.
        Simultaneously, my role as an IT Engineer at SmartCity Networks has honed my expertise in managing system-wide deployments, monitoring server infrastructure, and correcting connectivity faults. Proficient in SQL and SSH, I analyze and implement solutions for software problems while delivering Tier 2 IT support to company personnel. Additionally, I contribute to the development of protocols and programs using SQL, C++, and Python.
        During my time as the Roofing Sales and IT Team Lead at Rhino Roofers and Construction, LLC, I demonstrated strong leadership skills while providing exceptional customer support. I designed network configurations, established Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for system integration, and developed front-end and back-end solutions. Routine maintenance of SFTP servers further optimized file organization and directory usage.
        Previously, as a Pest Control Salesman at Romex Pest Control, I showcased my ability to tailor presentations, calculate costs, and oversee teams during pest control applications. Throughout my tenure, I consistently achieved revenue objectives and provided top-notch customer service.
        These experiences have equipped me with a versatile skill set in customer service, sales, technical troubleshooting, team leadership, and project management. Combining my passion for technology, commitment to customer satisfaction, and ability to adapt across industries, I am poised to make a meaningful impact in future endeavors.]

      <h3>[About me]</h3>
      <p>
        [Service towards others and fulfilling their needs is what is important to me. Starting at the age of 13 years old, I earned the award of Eagle Scout in the Boy Scouts of America while also completing over thirty-five merit badges including Entrepreneurship, Astronomy, and Survival. As I transitioned into High School as a part of the leadership committee, we constantly fulfilled the needs of our community by helping at local food banks and clothing centers. After the completion of my High School Degree, I served a seven-month long mission for my church in Hermosillo, Mexico from August 2018 to March 2019. Since then, my goal of immersing myself in the world of Computer Science has been eye opening. Being a part of the Association of Computing Science has helped my knowledge of Computer Technology grow to new heights and Iâ€™m thrilled for what chapter comes next.]
