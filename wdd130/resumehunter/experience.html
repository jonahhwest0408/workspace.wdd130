                <p> Since April 2019, my professional journey has been marked by diverse and impactful experiences across various industries and roles. As a co-founder, technician, and outreach specialist at Foucher Tech, my primary focus has revolved around delivering personalized and convenient tech support services to clients, with a particular emphasis on addressing the needs of seniors. I have excelled in troubleshooting software and hardware issues, resolving connectivity challenges, and ensuring optimal functionality across a wide range of devices. Simultaneously, my role as an IT Engineer at SmartCity Networks has further refined my expertise in managing large-scale system deployments, monitoring server infrastructure, and rectifying connectivity faults. Through my proficiency in SQL and SSH, I have successfully analyzed and implemented solutions for software problems while providing Tier 2 IT support to company personnel. Moreover, I have contributed to the development of protocols and programs utilizing SQL, C++, and Python.</p>
                <p>During my tenure as the Roofing Sales and IT Team Lead at Rhino Roofers and Construction, LLC, I demonstrated strong leadership skills while delivering exceptional customer support. I was responsible for designing network configurations, establishing Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for system integration, and developing both front-end and back-end solutions. Additionally, I implemented routine maintenance procedures for SFTP servers, resulting in optimized file organization and efficient directory usage. Previously, as a Pest Control Salesman at Romex Pest Control, I showcased my ability to tailor presentations, accurately calculate costs, and oversee teams during pest control applications. Throughout my time in this role, I consistently achieved revenue objectives and provided exemplary customer service. These diverse experiences have equipped me with a versatile skill set encompassing customer service, sales, technical troubleshooting, team leadership, and project management. By combining my passion for technology, commitment to customer satisfaction, and adaptability across industries, I am poised to make a meaningful impact in my future endeavors.</p>
