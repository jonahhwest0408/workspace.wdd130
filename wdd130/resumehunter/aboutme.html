              <p>My passion lies in providing service to others and meeting their needs. This commitment to service began at a young age, as I embarked on a journey in the Boy Scouts of America, ultimately earning the prestigious Eagle Scout award at the age of 13. Along the way, I delved into various subjects and acquired over thirty-five merit badges, ranging from Entrepreneurship to Astronomy and Survival. As I transitioned into High School, I eagerly joined the leadership committee, dedicated to making a positive impact on our community. Through our collective efforts, we consistently addressed the needs of those around us by volunteering at local food banks and clothing centers. These experiences instilled in me a deep sense of fulfillment and a drive to continue serving others.</p>

              <p>Upon completing my High School Degree, I embarked on a transformative seven-month mission for my church in Hermosillo, Mexico, from August 2018 to March 2019. This immersive experience allowed me to further develop my empathy, cultural understanding, and appreciation for different perspectives. Since then, my journey has led me to the captivating world of Computer Science. As I immerse myself in this field, I have been amazed by its limitless possibilities and the profound impact it can have on society. Through my involvement in the Association of Computing Science, my knowledge of Computer Technology has soared to new heights, fueling my enthusiasm for the next chapter of my journey. I am eager to continue combining my passion for service with my growing expertise in Computer Science, as I aspire to make a meaningful difference in the lives of others through technology-driven solutions.</p>
